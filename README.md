Assignment: CSS Hell
====================

This is an assignment to experiment with CSS and HTML techniques.

The assignment specification is outlined in requirements.org.

For Part I, the only modifications made to the gutenberg HTML files were
to remove the existing CSS, and replace it with a link to my custom style sheet.
