            <h2>Hello! I'm Jessica Yuen.</h2>

            <p>
            I'm a student about to graduate with a passion for software
            development and an interest in design. My primary areas of interest
            are web development and mobile development. Above all, however,
            I seek the opportunity to work on a project that I believe in, and
            one that allows me to challenge myself by solving complex and
            interesting problems. I like learning and working with new
            technologies, and the start up scene has always been of interest
            to me.
            </p>
            <p>I have strong Computing Science fundamentals, and I am well
            versed in data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented
            programming.
            </p>

                  <p>
                  Review Board is an open source project for code review used
                  by many companies including VMWare, Twitter, and Mozilla. I
                  contributed by creating Review Board Gateway, a lightweight
                  hosting service extension written in Google Go that allows
                  users to connect their remote SCM repositories to Review
                  Board without the need for a third party platform. Review
                  Board Gateway provides an API on top of repositories that
                  allows Review Board to perform functionalities such as
                  file retrieval and checking for file existance with ease.

                  Scout is a project that aims to better gather customer data

                  in the ongoing development of a web service, an Android

                  hardware to make this research prototype a reality.

                  <p>
                  Fronar is a video game that takes a twist on your classical
                  survival based tower defense game by allowing the
                  player to control up to four characters to strategically
                  defend against hordes of enemies. As the player, you can
                  travel during the day where you are faced with event choices
                  that will affect your team moral and valuable
                  resources needed during night defenses. As one of the
                  main programmers, I am responsible for implementing many
                  game mechanics and assuring the player has a bug-free,
                  enjoyable playing experience.
